# Project-1_Tic_TacToe

This project is about creating the famous game "Tic Tac Toe".
We should implement the knowledge you acquired during the past 2 weeks to design and build the game.

# Technical Requirements

Your Tic Tac Toe app must:

Render a game board in the browser
Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row, or show a draw if neither player wins
Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
Use JavaScript and/or jQuery for DOM manipulation
Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
We will be walking you through this process!
Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
Have well-formatted, and well-commented code
